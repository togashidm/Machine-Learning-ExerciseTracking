The practicing not only improve the body physical conditions or fitness but also decrease the likehood of many ills related to sedentarism, such as heart diseases. But, it is not only the act or quantity of doing physical exercise that matters. Many people usually forget that physical exercises when are done in the wrong way, they are, on one hand, less effective. On the other hand they can be very damaging causing undesirable injuries. Therefore, the right way to perform the exercise is considered a top priority.\r\nThis project is based on the work made by Veloso et al. \"Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises\". The authors have mounted sensors in six male volunteers to lift a relatively light dumbbell (1.25kg). Five different ways (only one correct) to perform the lift exercise were monitored by the sensors. The data collected were analysed and a machine learning model was built to assess the correctness and feedbacking the user at real-time; increasing the likewood of the exercise effectiviness. \r\n\r\n###Scope:\r\nAs part of the Coursera assessment, the work described here are restricted to answer the followings:\r\n\r\n1.  To predict the manner in which the exercise was done.\r\n2.  To create a report describing how a proposed model was built (this present document).\r\n3.  To show how cross validation was implemented\r\n4.  To analyse the sample error.\r\n5.  To discuss the assumptions made.\r\n6.  To apply the proposed model to predict 20 different test cases.\r\n\r\n###Experiment description: \r\nSix (6) volunteers weared four (4) \"9 Degrees of Freedom - Razor IMU\". Each one of Razor IMU is composed of three sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer, in which of them provides 3 degrees of freedom. Therefore, a total of 9 degrees of freedom per location. The four locations were:\r\n\r\n1. glove\r\n2. armband\r\n3. lumbar belt\r\n4. dumbbell \r\n\r\nThe volunteers, then, performed one set of 10 repetitions of the activity \"Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl\" in five different \"classes\":\r\n- Class A - The rigth exercise (i.e., exactly according to the specification)\r\n- Class B - Throwing the elbows to the front (i.e., wrong)\r\n- Class C - Lifting the dumbbell only halfway (i.e., wrong)\r\n- Class D - Lowering the dumbbell only halfway (i.e., wrong)\r\n- Class E - Throwing the hips to the front (i.e., wrong).\r\n\r\nThe volunteers were male participants aged between 20-28 years and data were collected at a constant rate of 45Hz.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Exploratory Data analysis:\r\n\r\n####1.\tDownload the data from a provided URL.\r\n\r\n    fileUrl <- \"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv\"\r\n    download.file(fileUrl, destfile=\"./pml-training.csv\") \r\n    fileUrl <- \"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv\"\r\n    download.file(fileUrl, destfile=\"./pml-testing.csv\") \r\n\r\n####2.\tLoad to R Global environment the files from their respective folders.\r\n\r\n    pml.training <- read.csv(\"pml-training.csv\",header=TRUE, na.strings=c(\"\",\"NA\",\"#DIV/0!\"))\r\n    pml.testing  <- read.csv(\"pml-testing.csv\", header=TRUE, na.strings=c(\"\",\"NA\",\"#DIV/0!\"))\r\n\r\n####3.\tTake a look at the data and analyse the data structure\r\n\r\n    str(pml.training)\r\n    \r\nRaw data variables for each sensor per location recorded as follow:\r\n*   Triaxial accelerometer:  3 (x,y,z) x 4 (locations) = 12\r\n*   Triaxial gyroscope:      3 (x,y,z) x 4 (locations) = 12 \r\n*   Triaxial  magnetometer:  3 (x,y,z) x 4 (locations) = 12 \r\nA total of 36 raw data variables were then recorded.\r\n\r\nIt was recorded also \"fusion\" variables obtained form the raw data variables:\r\n*   Three Rotational angles (roll, pitch, yaw) per location:     3  x 4 (locations) = 12\r\n*   Total acceleration per location:                             1  x 4 (locations) = 4\r\n\r\nInside the Razor IMU, the data of accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope are \"fused\" by using a Direction Cosine Matrix (DCM) algorithm. Therefored, a total of 16 \"fused\" variables were then recorded.\r\nAlso, for some of \"fused\" variables, the following \"stat\" (or descriptive statistics) variables were recorded:\r\n*   Max, Min, standard deviation(stddev), variance(var), average(avg) of rotational angles:     5 x 12 = 60      \r\n*   Amplitude of rotational angles (amplitude):                                                 3 x 4  = 12\r\n*   kurtosis and skewness of rotational angles:                                                 2 x 12 = 24\r\n*   variance(var) of total acceleration:                                                        1 x 4  = 4\r\nA total of 100 \"stat\" variables.\r\n\r\nOther variables:\r\n*   Volunteer ID (user_name)\r\n*   Exercise type (class)\r\n*   Index or observable number (X)\r\n*   time & date (cvtd_timestamp)\r\n*   4 time variables (raw_timestample_part_1 & raw_timestample_part_1, new_window, num_window)\r\nA total of 8 other variables\r\n\r\nFinally, the experiment recorded a total number of 160 (36 + 16 + 100 + 8) variables.\r\nEach individual performed 5 \"classes\" of exercises. Each exercise was repeat 10 times. All together derived a total of 19642 recorded observables, which were then split by Coursera into two files:\r\n*  train set to create the Model loaded as \"pml.training\" is a dataframe of 19622 x 160 \r\n*  test set to answer the Quiz loaded as \"pml.testing\"  is a dataframe of 20 x 160\r\n\r\n####4.  Clean the data by considering the rules of tidy data, and labelling the variables with descriptive names.\r\nCleaning the non-alphanumeric characters, and using CamelCase structure\r\n\r\n    temp=names(pml.training)\r\n    temp=gsub(\"^a\",\"A\",temp); temp=gsub(\"^c\",\"C\",temp); temp=gsub(\"^c\",\"C\",temp); temp=gsub(\"^g\",\"G\",temp); \r\n    temp=gsub(\"^k\",\"K\",temp); temp=gsub(\"^m\",\"M\",temp); temp=gsub(\"^n\",\"N\",temp); temp=gsub(\"^p\",\"P\",temp);\r\n    temp=gsub(\"^r\",\"R\",temp); temp=gsub(\"^s\",\"S\",temp); temp=gsub(\"^t\",\"T\",temp); temp=gsub(\"^u\",\"U\",temp);\r\n    temp=gsub(\"^v\",\"V\",temp); temp=gsub(\"^y\",\"Y\",temp); temp=gsub(\"_a\",\"A\",temp); temp=gsub(\"_b\",\"B\",temp);\r\n    temp=gsub(\"_c\",\"C\",temp); temp=gsub(\"_d\",\"D\",temp); temp=gsub(\"_f\",\"F\",temp); temp=gsub(\"_g\",\"G\",temp);\r\n    temp=gsub(\"_k\",\"K\",temp); temp=gsub(\"_m\",\"M\",temp); temp=gsub(\"_n\",\"N\",temp); temp=gsub(\"_p\",\"P\",temp);\r\n    temp=gsub(\"_r\",\"R\",temp); temp=gsub(\"_s\",\"S\",temp); temp=gsub(\"_t\",\"T\",temp); temp=gsub(\"_u\",\"U\",temp);\r\n    temp=gsub(\"_v\",\"V\",temp); temp=gsub(\"_x\",\"X\",temp); temp=gsub(\"_y\",\"Y\",temp); temp=gsub(\"_w\",\"W\",temp);\r\n    temp=gsub(\"_z\",\"Z\",temp); temp=gsub(\"_1\",\"1\",temp); temp=gsub(\"_2\",\"2\",temp);\r\n\r\n    TidyData = pml.training\r\n    colnames(TidyData) = temp\r\n\r\nThere are missing values (i.e. 'NA') in the data. We can check if the proportion is relevant by:\r\n\r\n    mean(is.na(TidyData))\r\n\r\nOver 61% of the data is missed and this is very significant. So, we can set a threshold to remove variables that contain more than 95% of 'NA', for example:\r\n\r\n    NewTidyData1 = TidyData[, colSums(is.na(TidyData))/nrow(TidyData) < 0.95]\r\n    dim(NewTidyData1)\r\n    mean(is.na(NewTidyData))\r\n\r\nThe NewTidyData now does not contain any missed value. Note that some over variables that were removed may contain observable values. So, we can create a second data set of the remainder of first data set (varibles with less than 95% of 'NA') but without observables that contain \"NA\": \r\n\r\n    temp= TidyData[, colSums(is.na(TidyData))/nrow(TidyData) > 0.95]\r\n\r\nIt is also possible that there are variables AND observables that only have 'NA', so:\r\n\r\n    NewTidyData2 = temp[, colSums(is.na(temp))/nrow(temp) != 1]\r\n    NewTidyData2 = na.omit(NewTidyData2)\r\n    dim(NewTidyData2)\r\n\r\nWhat are the variables that does not contain any observable values?\r\n\r\n    setdiff(names(temp),names(NewTidyData2))\r\n    \r\n####5.\tNow we are going to take a look at the structure of the NewTidyData1\r\n\r\n    str(NewTidyData1)\r\n\r\nThere are a total of 60 variables. We can still reduce the number of variables *assuming* that the prediction is not time and individual dependent. Then, variables such as: \"UserName\", \"RawTimestampPart1\", \"RawTimestampPart2\", \"CvtdTimestamp\",      \"NewWindow\" and \"NumWindow\" can be removed together with the index \"X\" variable. Therefore, the number of variables is reduced to 53.\r\n\r\n    library(dplyr)\r\n    SelectData = select(NewTidyData1,-c(X:NumWindow))\r\n    dim(SelectData)\r\n\r\n####6.\tPropose Machine learning models base on the exploratory data \r\n\r\nI have applied the caret package in this. Caret stands for Classification And REgression Training. It is a great toolkit for building classification models and regression models. Caret also provides means for:\r\n– Data preparation\r\n– Data splitting\r\n- Training a Model\r\n– Model evaluation\r\n– Variable selection\r\n\r\n#####Data Preparation - Removing redudant variables by a correlation matrix:\r\nThe data variables may be correlated to each other, which it may lead to rendundancy in the model. By using \"findCorrelation\" from the Caret R package, we can obtain the correlation matrix of between the data variables, and remove those variables with correlation coefficient larger than 0.9 (arbitrary threshold).\r\n\r\n    library(caret)\r\n    threshold <-0.90\r\n    corMatrix<-cor(SelectData[,1:52])\r\n    highCor <-findCorrelation(corMatrix, threshold)\r\n    highCorRm <-row.names(corMatrix)[highCor]\r\n    highCorRm\r\n    [1] \"AccelBeltZ\"    \"RollBelt\"       \"AccelBeltY\"     \"AccelBeltX\"     \"GyrosDumbbellX\" \"GyrosDumbbellZ\" \"GyrosArmX\"\r\n\r\n    SelectData2 <- SelectData[, -highCor]\r\n    dim(SelectData2)\r\n\r\n#####Data spliting:\r\n\r\nThe function createDataPartition is used to randomly split the data set. It is set 60% of the data to be used for model training and 40% used for testing model performance.\r\n\r\n    library(\"caret\")\r\n    library(\"e1071\")\r\n    set.seed(123)\r\n    inTrain <- createDataPartition(SelectData$Class, p = 0.6, list = FALSE)\r\n    trainData <- SelectData[inTrain,]\r\n    testData <- SelectData[-inTrain,]\r\n    modelFit1 = train(Classe ~., data=trainData, method=\"rf\", prox=TRUE)\r\n\r\n    library(\"caret\")\r\n    set.seed(1023)\r\n    inTrain <- createDataPartition(SelectData2$Class, p = 0.6, list = FALSE)\r\n    trainData <- SelectData2[inTrain,]\r\n    testData <- SelectData2[-inTrain,]\r\n    modelFit2 = train(Classe ~., data=trainData, method=\"rf\", prox=TRUE)\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n####Training a Model/Tuning Parameters/Building the Final model\r\n\r\nAs the question is about classification, I choose Random Forest (\"rf\") the method to build the model. Tuning the model means to choose a set of parameters to be evaluated. Once the model and tuning parameters are choosen, the type of resampling (cross-validation) need to be opted. Caret Package is able to perfom, k-fold cross-validation (once or repeated), leave-one-out cross-validation and bootstrap resampling methods. I have choosen two type of resampling to evaluate the performance: Bootstrap (default) and k-fold cross-validation (once or repeated). Once the resampling is processed the caret \"train\" function automatically chooses the best tuning parameters associated to the model.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing correlation to reduce number of variable and

(cross-validatios) are:\r\n\r\n* bootstrapping,\r\n* k-fold cross-validation,\r\n* leave-one-out cross-validation,\r\n* leave-group-out cross-validation (i.e., repeated splits without replacement).\r\n\r\n#######using k-fold CV \r\nIn this work two cross-validations will be evaluated: Boststrapping and k-fold cross-validation\r\n\r\n#######Predictor importance\r\nThe generic function varImp can be used to characterize the general selection of predictors on\r\nthe model. The varImp function works with the following object classes: lm, mars, earth,\r\nrandomForest, gbm, mvr (in the pls package), rpart, RandomForest (from the party package),\r\npamrtrained, bagEarth, bagFDA, classbagg and regbagg. varImp also works with objects\r\nproduced by train, but this is a simple wrapper for the speci\fc models previously listed\r\n\r\n    date()\r\n    set.seed(2825)\r\n

To predict the manner in which the exercise was done.\r\n2.  To create a report describing how a proposed model was built (this present document).\r\n3.  To show how cross validation was implemented\r\n4.  To analyse the sample error.\r\n5.  To discuss the assumptions made.\r\n6.  To apply the proposed model to predict 20 different test cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Remarks:\r\n\r\n*  The variables were labeled within CamelCase structure. The variables description of the NewTidyData is presented in the Appendix B.\r\n*  Codes applied here are described in Appendix C.\r\n\r\n***************************************************\r\n####Reference:\r\nhttp://wiki.ros.org/razor_imu_9dof\r\nhttps://perceptual.mpi-inf.mpg.de/files/2013/03/velloso13_ah.pdf\r\nhttps://www.sparkfun.com/products/10736\r\nhttp://www.starlino.com/imu_guide.html\r\nhttp://www.aliexpress.com/item/DFRobot-9-degrees-of-freedom-inertial-navigation-sensors-9DOF-Razor-IMU-AHRS-compatib/1544796282.html\r\n\"Exploratory Data Analysis with R\" Roger D.
